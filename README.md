# StudyBridge Cloud

StudyBridge Cloud is the server-backed version of StudyBridge. It adds login, invitation-only registration, a creator console, per-student cloud data, and a backend AI API so the OpenAI key never appears in browser code.

## Features

- Login and registration with salted `scrypt` password hashes
- Invitation-only registration
- Creator/admin account controlled by `ADMIN_EMAILS`
- Creator console for creating, copying, enabling, and disabling invite codes
- Creator overview of registered students and their course/document/chat counts
- HttpOnly session cookie
- Per-student courses, course documents, preferences, and chat history
- Backend AI calls using `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Local JSON database for development or small private deployments
- Optional DynamoDB storage for AWS production

## Local Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm ci
node server.js
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Before registering the creator account, set these in `.env`:

```text
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-real-email@example.com
OWNER_INVITE_CODE=your-private-creator-code
```

Register with that email and owner invite code. After login, the creator console appears inside the app.

## Health Checks

```bash
npm run check
npm test
npm audit --omit=dev
```

Tests use isolated temporary databases and disable external AI, email, and Google services.
Pushes to `main` run these checks before the Lightsail deployment. Historical one-time
hotfix workflows are preserved in `.github/legacy-workflows` and no longer run automatically
or overwrite the checked source. Some archived definitions contain invalid YAML and are
kept only as historical references.

## Important Environment Variables

```text
SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
ADMIN_EMAILS=your-real-email@example.com
REQUIRE_INVITE_CODE=true
OWNER_INVITE_CODE=your-private-creator-code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_SIMPLE_MODEL=gpt-6-luna
OPENAI_COMPLEX_MODEL=gpt-6.1-sol
OPENAI_SOL_ROUTE_PERCENT=15
```

For AWS DynamoDB:

```text
STUDYBRIDGE_DB=dynamodb
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
DYNAMODB_TABLE=StudyBridge
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=
```

## Deployment

See:

```text
docs/aws-deploy.md
```

GitHub Pages can only serve the older static app. This cloud version needs a Node server, so deploy it to AWS Lightsail, EC2, Render, Railway, Fly.io, or another Node hosting provider.
