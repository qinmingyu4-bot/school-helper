# StudyBridge Version Archive

This file records stable StudyBridge versions so a broken update can be rolled back safely.

## Policy

- Every production update should bump `package.json` version.
- Every production update should add one entry below with the version, date, purpose, and important GitHub commit IDs.
- If a release breaks the live app, restore the files from the previous stable commit or re-run the previous deployment.

## Stable Versions

### 1.0.95 - 2026-10-08

Purpose:
- Stabilize the left sidebar navigation after route conflicts caused blank pages and broken feature areas.
- Disable the old `six-zone-router-equalizer` loader path.
- Add `public/main-nav-stabilizer.js` as the final owner of the six student navigation entries.

GitHub commits:
- `fadcb3ebf277851ca1544f5804166a816de7bbfb` - add stable main navigation controller.
- `8795f1e2eb93beb8b2eff73e0b2edf8097f6a017` - load stable navigation and stop loading the old six-zone router.
- `7ea34bca5ab3bd8d865fa58ff84f8f25355dfeac` - bump package version to 1.0.95.

Rollback target:
- If `1.0.95` fails, restore the repository to the last known working commit before these three commits, then let the AWS auto-sync pull it.

Live checks used:
- `http://3.98.63.195:3000/main-nav-stabilizer.js` returns the `1.0.95` script.
- `http://3.98.63.195:3000/google-auth-patch.js` includes `main-nav-stabilizer` and no longer includes `six-zone-router-equalizer`.
